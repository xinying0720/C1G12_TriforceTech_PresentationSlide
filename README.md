# C1G12_TriforceTech_PresentationSlide

## An Interactive Presentation Slide 
This frontend project is an *interactive, animation-rich* presentation slide built using React, TailwindCSS, and several custom visual components. It was created to present SolarAid, a digital solution aligned with *SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, developed by Triforce Tech.*

The slide showcases the problem statement, solution architecture, AI features, market analysis, and social impact of the SolarAid platform.

## Purpose of This Frontend
This application is not a traditional web app.
It serves as a full-screen animated presentation deck that replaces tools like PowerPoint or Google Slides.
```
The goal is to create a more immersive visual experience through:
- Parallax effects

- Interactive zoomable system diagram
